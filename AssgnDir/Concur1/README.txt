Concurrency Assignment 1
Jacob Mahugh & Alannah Oleson
CS444 - Operating Systems II

To run the program, run these commands (after un-tarring the files):

make
concurrency1 (# consumers) (# producers) [debug]
//Note: the debug is optional, and limits the amount of locks each producer/
//consumer can do to 10. Simply not putting it will result in normal execution.
echo Wow that was a nice program!
